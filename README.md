## My process

- created wrapper with full view height to center the card, and used column flex box to center contents inside the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

```HTML
Alt tag should not incldue hyphens and it should tell readers the purpose of the image. Do not include image, photo in alt tag.
If possible, </br> should not be used for line breaks as it can disrupt screen readers when reading the paragraph.
```

```css
The first project took me more than I expected. It helped me understand width and height of CSS more. Setting HTML font size 62.5% have compatibility issues with third-party libraries and possibly cause problems in the future.
```
